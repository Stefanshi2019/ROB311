INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
  - Complete the method  get_transition_model which creates the
    transition probability matrix for the cleanign robot problem desribed in the
    project document.
  - Please write abundant comments and write neat code
  - You can write any number of local functions
  - More implementation details in the Function comments

def get_transition_model(env: cleaning_env) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    get_transition_model method creates a table of size (SxSxA) that represents the
    probability of the agent going from s1 to s2 while taking action a
    e.g. P[s1,s2,a] = 0.5
    This is the method that will be used by the cleaning environment (described in the
    project document) for populating its transition probability table

    Inputs
    --------------
        env: The cleaning environment

    Outputs
    --------------
        P: Matrix of size (SxSxA) specifying all of the transition probabilities.
